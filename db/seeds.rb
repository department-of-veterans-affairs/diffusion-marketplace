        summary: 'The VHA Rapid Naloxone Initiative acts as a safety belt in case of an overdose and saves the lives of our Veterans which creates a safer environment around the veteran on VA campuses. Since the adoption of at least one element in the Initiative within at least 43 facilities, there have been at least 44 successful overdose reversals within FY2018. The Initiative’s plan to spread across the nation has the potential to drastically increase the number of successful reversals within FY2019, improving patient safety across the VA.

The Initiative has a significant impact on the patient safety within VA medical facilities and patient experience. First responders have testified about the positive impact of the Initiative and the role it played in saving their lives and creating a safer environment. One such rescue was a 27-year-old male Veteran who experienced an overdose at a Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (SARRTP), which is located on hospital grounds but some distance from the main building. Because of the availability of naloxone in the AED cabinet, the initial dose was administered to the Veteran before VA police arrived on the scene. The Veteran survived the overdose and was transported to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for further treatment. Without the quick access of naloxone, this Veteran could have lost his life. His story, as well as many other many Veteran overdose survival stories, has pushed this Initiative into the national spotlight and sparked a flame for action to implement around the nation. ',

        summary: 'Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a substantial health risk for patients during their hospital stays. Anywhere from 15-31% of patients who contract HAP die from the disease or related complications, like sepsis. Until now, prevention efforts have focused on ventilated patients due to their increased risk of contracting pneumonia, with non-ventilated patients largely overlooked.

Poor oral hygiene increases the risk of HAP, with germs in the mouth rapidly multiplying and frequently aspirating into the lungs during sleep. Regular tooth brushing aids in removing these germs. By engaging Veterans in proper oral care practices, nurses teach the importance of good oral hygiene and its ability to reduce pneumonia rates and length of hospital stays. Project HAPPEN is a nurse-driven intervention; with nurses in charge of patient care, they must own and drive the practice. Garnering buy-in from nursing staff and nursing executives is essential. Tracking cases and sharing results demonstrate that oral care is not simply a comfort measure, but essential patient care.

Project HAPPEN supports the Department’s Priorities by focusing on things that matter—in addition to reducing the risk of NV-HAP, Veterans feel better and see improvement in their quality of life; modernizing systems/processes with a focus on preventive care; and improving access and timeliness of service by reducing patient length of stays and freeing up bed space for other patients. Every facility that has implemented this practice has seen immediate drops in pneumonia rates (of at least 40-60%) and associated costs (an average of $40,000 per case), easily recouping oral care supply costs within three months. News media is paying attention, too, with word getting out through over 60 media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal.

Average cost to the VA for oral care supplies is $3.00 per patient.  The inpatient oral care intervention in VISN 6 and Houston VAMC saved an estimated $5.462M and 24 Veteran lives (October 2016- September 2018).
