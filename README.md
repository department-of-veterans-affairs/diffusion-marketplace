### Order of operations for running DM Specific rake tasks to set up data
1. Run `rails dm:full_import`

This will run:
1. `rails dm:db_setup` - sets up the db with `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`
2. `rails importer:import_answers` - imports the initial practice data the Diffusion Marketplace team collected via Survey Monkey, images and all~
3. `rails importer:initial_featured` - sets the first three initial featured practices for the homepage
4. `rails diffusion_history:all` - set up the initial diffusion history for the first five practices. Individual commands can be found here:  `lib/tasks/diffusion_history.rake`
5. `rails milestones:milestones_transfer` - transfers original timeline entry milestones to the new milestone model

To reset all of the data and do the process all over again, run:
```bash
rails dm:reset_up
```
