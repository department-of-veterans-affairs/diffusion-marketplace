Atlas Knee Supporter,Spark-Seed-Spread,FACILITY USE,"The Atlas Knee Supporter was designed as a supportive device to immobilize Veterans and provide comfort during an otherwise challenging knee pain management procedures. It could, however, be used for any similar procedure where a Veteran needs to be secured and stable. The device comes in two sizes for different size legs and supports comfortably from the hip to the ankle.",Coming soon!

Shipments are expected to begin in 2024.,"""I really felt bad for the patient and knew there had to be a way to streamline the procedure while giving comfort to the Veteran. With the very first trial the patient loved it and wanted to take it home!! Throughout the prototyping phase I had such an adrenaline rush from any design changed needed. Since 2021, the need to reschedule patients is at ZERO, and knee procedure time has been reduced by 15 minutes. Previously, 20% of patients were rescheduled due to pain, inability to hold still, or needing sedation. The benefits of the supporter and the data I collected include decreased radiation exposure to patient and staff, rescheduling, use of anesthesia and procedure time. The meaning of VA Innovation to me is knowing that I have lots of support behind me. I have had many people cheering me on and giving great suggestions. VA Innovation is the way to go!!!!""

One Veteran who used it told me that it 'changed his life'. He 'finally' understood how to properly use his prosthetic socks and a wound he had for a long time was finally beginning to heal. He also used the accompanying infographic to explain his amputation to his grandkids. He was so appreciative.""

""It was an awesome experience to work with the team Wareologie to take this great idea and see it come to physical fruition! We started from scratch with an idea on a power point, discussing balancing a Physical Therapists wants vs needs, and what the patient would absolutely need in order to feel safe and secure.

It is clear that the patients needs were most important, and the engineers really worked hard to understand what the patients would need for that tactile sense of security while also addressing the operational functions and materials.

Each meeting, we were able to collaborate our clinical needs with the engineers' structural knowledge to create what we think will be an incredibly useful and versatile tool for multiple clinicians in different settings.""

Hinged Bathtub Bench,Spark-Seed-Spread & Technology Transfer,Veteran use,"The benches and support legs of the most popular bathtub transfer device solutions extend beyond the width of the bathtub and do not allow the user to easily close the curtain during bathing. This results in unwanted, wasted space in the bathroom and the potential for water to escape the bathtub surrounding it.

These problems can introduce trip, slip, and fall hazards to users that already have difficulty ambulating and performing routine, daily tasks. A smaller footprint bathtub bench with a hinged transfer platform eliminates both of these issues.

The Hinged Bathtub Bench features a hinged platform that rests on the lip of the bathtub. This allows the user to transfer into and out of the bathtub, all while being able to close the curtain inside of the tub to prevent water from escaping. The bench is assembled completely within the walls of the bathtub, taking up less space outside of the tub making navigation in the bathroom much easier.",Coming Soon!

While that technique is unsafe, it gave me the idea that the lip of the tub could support a person's weight. I see how difficult lives can be for Veterans with disabilities and I drive myself to develop new products/techniques to make their lives easier.

Self-Leveling Walker (SLW),Spark-Seed-Spread & Technology Transfer,FACILITY USE,"The Self-Leveling Walker addresses the limitations of conventional walking aids and the lack of options for teaching efficient stair ascent/descent maneuvers for patients in rehabilitation recovering from an injury. This product helps fulfill an unmet market need giving patients increased independence to safely negotiate stairs and inclines while also minimizing the cost of home adaptations and extended stays in rehabilitation settings for training.

The walker's front and rear legs are coupled such that the front legs shorten, and the rear legs lengthen by the same amount when a pair of hand levers are held down by the user. When the levers are released, the legs are locked in the new configuration for continued stair or ramp ascent/descent until re-adjusted at the end of the staircase or incline. In the default state where the legs are level and locked, the device performs exactly like a standard walker on level surfaces, making it the only walker a user will ever need regardless of the environment.",GKG-4746,Coming soon!,AliMed,https://www.alimed.com/,05-600-7248,This product was just licensed and is expected to ramp-up product in 2024.,"""This innovation capitalized on the contributions of institutional investments by the Rehabilitation R&D Service, the VA Technology Transfer Program, the Case-Coulter Translational Research Program, and VHA Innovators Network to deliver something that can profoundly and positively impact the mobility of disabled Veterans and enable them to independently negotiate architectural barriers and take full advantage of life opportunities at home and in the community. And all without costly home modifications! I'm most proud that it's been patented and licensed and poised to be disseminated commercially within and outside the VA so that Veterans and all Americans can benefit.""

""As a physical therapist the Self-Leveling Walker solves a lot of issues for so many of our Veterans.

Contact OAM directly to place an order.,https://www.innovation.va.gov/oam/,N/A,This product was just licensed and is expected to ramp-up product in 2024,"Mr. Doug Hilliard, the VISN 4 Prosthetic Manager, recognized that the contracted O2 vendors for his VISN were reporting that ~20% of Veterans were removing the inline safety fuses that have been installed for at-home oxygen therapy setups, thinking it may impede O2 flow. Sensitive to this potential home oxygen issue being a safety risk and being preoccupied with failure, he took immediate action coming up with solutions to prevent tampering with the inline safety fuse.

In his garage, Mr. Hilliard developed the initial concepts for the clamshell lock which would cover and lock the thermal fuse in place, preventing fuse removal. After the clamshell solution was conceived, he worked with the engineering expertise at the Human Engineering Research Laboratory (HERL) team to further develop prototypes and secure a patent, later working with OAM to establish production capabilities within the VA for distribution of this device to Veterans.
