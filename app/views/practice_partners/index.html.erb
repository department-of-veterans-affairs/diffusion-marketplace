      <p>Best practices are being developed, vetted, and promoted
        by multiple offices within VA. The combined efforts of each office enable VA as a whole to advance the mission to
        fulfill President Lincoln's promise: "To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his
        orphan" by serving and honoring the men and women who are America's Veterans. Veterans deserve access to the best
        health care providers, state-of-art facilities, and cutting-edge technology.
