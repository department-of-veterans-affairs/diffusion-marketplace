#!/bin/bash
# Script used to deploy applications to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
# Should be hooked to CircleCI deploy workflow step
#
# Does three things:
# 1. Builds Docker image & pushes it to container registry
# 2. Generates new `Dockerrun.aws.json` file which is Beanstalk task definition
# 3. Creates new Beanstalk Application version using created task definition
#
# REQUIREMENTS!
# - AWS_ACCOUNT_ID env variable
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID env variable
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY env variable
#
# usage: ./deploy.sh name-of-application staging us-east-1 f0478bd7c2f584b41a49405c91a439ce9d944657
